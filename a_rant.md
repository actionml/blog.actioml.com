# A Rant About the Demise of Brick and Mortar and Old Media

I'm supposed to stick to technical topics but I just can't help going on a little rant here regarding the hopeless fumbing of many older companies trying to move from older print and broadcast media or brick and mortar stores into new-media online. 

&lt;rant&gt;We've all seen old media and retail companies die slow pitiful deaths over the last 20 years. The world has gone online and these companies still don't see themselves as technology companies, they think the web is just a new advertising or publishing platform. WAKE UP!

This move is not just about mastering the new medium and this is your fundemental and fatal mistake. This move takes you from competing with other media or retailers into competing with technology companies. Are any of you retailers ready to build a machine learning group with PhD Data Scientists and create recommenders of your own or implement personalized search or even deal with big-data, no? Then give up and sell out to someone who can before your assets are only real-estate.

Witness the fact that brick and mortar stores increasingly see sales move online but when they go online they see their market share continue to evaporate. Why (hint read the paragraph above)? Companies born online see themselves as technology companies first. Why bother go online if you aren't even going to try?

Aha, you say, but we don't have the tech nor the Data Scientists to implement it. This is the excuse of untold failing Product Managers around the world. But this is as transparent as it is false saying nothing about corporate needs and everything about corporate inertia. While you still have the resources to do it, WAKE UP.

I'm here to tell anyone willing to smell the toast burning that you too can become a technology company, at first by finding good hire guns who ARE technology experts, and later by building your own core competencies in-house. Look at the born-on-the-internet best of breed companies, what tech do they apply? Don't even stop to ask yourselves if you understand it because you don't. Your only hope is to find trustworthy experts with the maturity to help you build these technologies into your apps and do it now because they aren't waiting for you.

OK, end-of-rant.&lt;/rant&gt;
