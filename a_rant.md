# The New Rules of The Game

Today Wal-Mart Stores, Inc,  one of the largest brick and mortar retailer, announced a major effort to build a bleeding edge high-tech enclave with full financial and executive support.

Quote Bloomberg: "The incubator will partner with startups, venture capitalists and academics to promote innovation in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to Wal-Mart."

Traditional media and retail companies have been experiencing a slow decline over the last 20 years. The world has gone online and many of these companies have not yet transitioned to see themselves as technology companies; web is still viewed just as a new advertising or publishing platform. The move online is not just about mastering the new medium. This change forces traditional media companies or retailers from competing with other media or retailers into competing with technology companies that are designed to leverage bleeding edge technologies to help their customers discover and purchase online. 

Making the transition requires transforming company culture and core competency. And time is the essence. Walmartâ€™s 3B+ acquisition of jet.com gives Walmart the technology talent and leadership overnight. The incubation is also a big step in speeding up innovations that will ultimately allow them to compete with technology companies in the commerce space.
