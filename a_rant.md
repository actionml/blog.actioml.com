# The Demise of Brick and Mortar and Old Media: The New Rules of The Game

I'm supposed to stick to technical topics but I just can't help going on a bit of a rant here regarding the hopeless fumbling of many older companies trying to move online. Today one of the old-timers, once a huge winner in brick and mortar retailing, did the right thing. After decades of half measures Wal-Mart took made what seems to be an all-in bet. They announced a major effort to build a bleeding edge high-tech enclave with full financial and executive support.

<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-20/wal-mart-unveils-store-no-8-tech-incubator-in-silicon-valley" target="_blank"><image src="/blog/images/wal-mart.jpg"></image></a>

Quoth Bloomberg: "The incubator will partner with startups, venture capitalists and academics to promote innovation in robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, according to Wal-Mart."

We've all seen old media and retail companies die slow inevitable deaths over the last 20 years. The world has gone online and these companies still don't see themselves as technology companies, they think the web is just a new advertising or publishing platform. All I can say to this, and do read at high volume: WAKE UP!

The move online is not just about mastering the new medium and this is your fundamental and fatal mistake. This move takes you from competing with other media or retailers into competing with technology companies. Are any of you retailers ready to build a machine learning group with PhD Data Scientists and create recommenders of your own or implement personalized search or even deal with big-data? No? Then give up and sell out to someone who can before your assets become worthless.

Witness the fact that brick and mortar stores increasingly see sales move online but when they go online they see their market share continue to evaporate. Why&mdash;hint read the paragraph above? Companies born online see themselves as technology companies first and since they are winning, they write the rules.

Aha, you say, but we don't have the tech nor the Data Scientists to implement it. We don't have managers who get it, we don't have the execs to support it, we have no clue how to make these decisions, starting with hiring. These are the excuses of failing corporate managers at all levels. Though they may be true, they are clearly a trap you set for yourself.

I'm here to tell anyone willing to smell the toast burning that you too can become a technology company, at first by finding good hired guns who ARE technology experts, and later by building your own core competencies in-house. Look at the born-on-the-internet best of breed companies, what tech do they apply? Don't even stop to ask yourselves if you understand it because you don't. Your only hope is to find trustworthy experts with the maturity to help you build these technologies and do it now because the competition isn't waiting for you.

Wal-Mart, kudos. This is exactly what they are doing. They were big enough to buy Jet.com for $3+ Billion and got Marc Lore who is heading their incubator initiative. Other companies can start with good smart consultants and learn from them, but do something.
