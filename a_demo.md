# A Demo is Worth a Thousand Words

While developing The Universal Recommender we created a demo app. We got real data from RottenTomatoes.com reviewers so it makes real recommendations, give it a try. You need to create an account then go to the trainer, which leads you through a bunch of specially chosen videos you can like or dislike. Once you have a few preferences it makes personalized recommendations.

This turned out to be a great experiment because we were able to get lots of user preference indicators. You might not guess it but we found user *dislikes* helped predict *likes*.

This demo uses ActionML's Universal Recommender for multi-action recommendations and Clustering to pick the most differentiating videos for the trainer. We illustrate several UR features here like the use of video properties to narrow down recommendations in a hybrid of Collaborative Filtering and Content-based recommendations. 

Caveat Emptor: Sorry for dupes in the Videos list, RT could use a little data scrubbing. Donâ€™t expect much from search it is only minimally hooked up for how.
