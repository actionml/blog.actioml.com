# A Demo is Worth a Thousand Words

![image](/blog/images/Guide-front-1024x7211.png)

Last year using an older version of the Universal Recommender I built a little demo app. It runs in my closet on an old desktop over Comcast so don’t expect speed but it does work fairly nice. I got the recommender data by scraping Rottentomatoes for reviews so there isn’t a huge amount of training data but give it a try. You need to create an account so it can track your preferences then try out the trainer, which leads you through a bunch of specially chosen videos you can rate. Once you have a few preferences it makes recommendations.

Caveat Emptor: Sorry for dupes in the Videos list, there are several names for the same content in RT. Don’t expect much from search it is only minimally hooked up for how.
